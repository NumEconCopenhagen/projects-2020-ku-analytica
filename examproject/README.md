The Exam Project contains three different questions:

Linear regression - We're estimating and plotting a linear regression. Furthermore we're estimating with two different solvers (following OLS- and LAD-method). Lastly we're comparing the results by plotting the estimationvalues.

Durable purchases: Finding and plotting different functions in a household problem. We're solving different periods in an economic model with many constraints.

Gradient descent: Implementing an algorithm for finding a minimum in a function. The focus in this question is to construct an algoritm step by step to make it run properly.
