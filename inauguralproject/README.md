# Inaugural project
The goal of this assignment was to get an understanding general use of python and an understanding of the link between VSCode and github. 
In the assignment we got the chance to learn to use functions, loops, plotting and several other features in python. 

The assignment, in it self, introduced us to solving economic problems, regarding different utility-functions and constraints.
